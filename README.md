# Hi there, I’m Dawood 👋

Welcome to my corner of GitHub!  
I’m a high school student from Pakistan, currently in my final year and on a mission to learn how to code (and maybe take over the world with my curiosity—watch out! 🚀).

## A little about me:

- 🧑‍🎓 Still in high school, but my brain’s always in “learning mode.”
- 💻 New to coding, but hey, everyone starts somewhere, right?
- 🧠 My superpower? Insatiable curiosity and a knack for learning things (sometimes even before breakfast).
- 🔢 Math is my jam, and I love solving problems—even the ones that make calculators sweat!
- ⚡ Favorite subject: Physics! Because who doesn’t want to understand how the universe works?

## What am I doing here?

- Practicing my coding skills
- Breaking things (accidentally, I swear 😅)
- Solving puzzles, asking questions, and occasionally yelling “EUREKA!” at my screen

## Social Links

I’ll add my social links here once I make them. Until then, just imagine a bunch of cool icons floating around.
